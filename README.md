# AI & ML 

# AI and Data Science Basics

## 1. What is Human Intelligence?

- Intelligence means the human ability to acquire, understand, and apply knowledge and skills.  
- Humans have cognitive abilities: memory, logic/reasoning, creativity, emotional understanding, and communication.  
- Intelligence includes reasoning, problem-solving, learning, adapting to new situations, and making decisions.  

## 2. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

- AI enables machines to simulate human intelligence by thinking and acting like humans.  
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) mimics the human brain to simulate intelligence in machines.  
- Machines demonstrate similar abilities — such as learning from data, recognizing patterns, making predictions, or solving problems — without being explicitly programmed for every task.  

## 3. Branches of AI

1. **Machine Learning (ML):** Enabling machines to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.  
   _Examples:_ Spam detection, recommendation systems, image recognition.  
2. **Deep Learning:** A subset of ML that uses neural networks with several layers to model complex patterns.  
   _Examples:_ Voice assistants, self-driving cars, facial recognition.  
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  
   _Examples:_ Chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis.  
4. **Computer Vision (CV):** Teaching machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.  
   _Examples:_ Medical imaging, object detection, facial recognition.  
5. **Expert Systems:** Mimicking human decision-making using rule-based systems.  
   _Examples:_ Medical diagnosis tools, financial advisory systems.  
6. **Robotics:** Building intelligent machines that can perform tasks in the physical world.  
   _Examples:_ Industrial robots, autonomous drones, robotic vacuum cleaners.  
7. **Reinforcement Learning:** Training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors.  
   _Examples:_ Game-playing AIs (like AlphaGo), robotic movement control.  
8. **Fuzzy Logic:** Handling reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.  
   _Examples:_ Washing machines, air conditioners with adaptive controls.  
9. **Cognitive Computing:** Simulating human thought processes in a computerized model.  
   _Examples:_ Virtual assistants that understand context and emotions.  

## 4. What is Data Science?

**Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.  

- **Goal:** To turn raw data into meaningful information for decision-making  
- **Involves:** Statistics, programming, machine learning, and domain knowledge
